# üíÖ VS Code Custom CSS & JS üíª

This repo contains my personal customizations for Visual Studio Code using the legendary [Custom CSS and JS Loader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css) extension.

These styles are designed to:
- Add a modern, aesthetic twist to the UI
- Enhance focus and usability
- Inject **chaotic good energy** into a boring editor

## üß† What‚Äôs Inside

- `custom.css` ‚Äì Pure style, baby. Themes, blur effects, layout tweaks, neon glow-ups... you name it.
- `custom.js` ‚Äì DOM wizardry. JS that changes how VS Code behaves, adds UI interactivity, or auto-hacks elements for power users.
- Optionally a `screenshots/` folder with before-after proof of how slick it looks.

2. Open VS Code `settings.json` and add:
